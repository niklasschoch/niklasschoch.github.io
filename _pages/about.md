I am a PhD student in economics at **Sciences Po Paris**, where I am fortunate to be supervised by **Johannes Boehm** and **Stefan Pollinger**. 

My research focuses on **carbon pricing** and **green technology adoption in concentrated industries**, as well as the **market design of emission trading systems**. Previous work includes reduced-form evaluations of **local economic impacts of wind power deployment**, and **emission-reducing effects of international climate finance**.

Prior to joining **Sciences Po**, I obtained a masterâ€™s degree in economics from the **University of Mannheim** and worked on energy policy as a consultant at the **Institute of Energy Economics at the University of Cologne**. During my second year, I joined the **International Energy Agency (IEA)** part-time as a **Junior Energy Analyst** in the **Power Markets Division**.
