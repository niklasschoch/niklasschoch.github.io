**Welcome!** I’m a PhD candidate in economics at Sciences Po Paris, where I’m fortunate to be advised by Johannes Boehm and Stefan Pollinger. For the Spring term 2025, I visited Columbia University.

My research lies at the intersection of environmental economics and industrial organization, where I use structural methods to study the implications of carbon pricing on green technology adoption in concentrated industries. I also work on the applied theory of emissions trading system design, focusing on endogenous cap adjustment in the presence of market power. Earlier work includes a reduced-form evaluations of the local economic impacts of wind power deployment and the emission-reducing effects of international climate finance.

Before joining Sciences Po, I earned an MSc in Economics from the University of Mannheim and worked as an energy policy consultant at the Institute of Energy Economics (EWI) in Cologne. During the second year of my PhD, I joined the International Energy Agency (IEA) as a part-time Junior Energy Analyst in the Power Markets Division.
